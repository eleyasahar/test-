                    Parliament Session Live Updates: The Monsoon Session of Parliament will resume on Wednesday at 11am in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, a day after proceedings were adjourned following a charged debate on Operation Sindoor — India’s military response to the Pahalgam terror attack.
                    Tuesday’s session witnessed intense political back-and-forth, with sharp exchanges between the ruling party and the opposition. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address, praised the Armed Forces for their swift and decisive action. Calling it “the new normal,” he said India would no longer tolerate cross-border terrorism. He also stressed that India acted independently, without external pressure, stating, “Told US Vice President that if Pakistan attacks India, our attack would be much bigger as we will respond to bullets with cannons.”

                    A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula early Wednesday, triggering tsunami warnings across the northern Pacific, including Alaska, Hawaii, and down to New Zealand. Sirens sounded in Honolulu as residents moved to higher ground. In Japan, a 40 cm tsunami was detected in Hokkaido. Russia’s Severo-Kurilsk saw initial tsunami waves, prompting evacuations, though no serious injuries were reported. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center confirmed the tsunami, urging immediate precautions. U.S. coastal areas, including Oregon, expected small waves of 1–3 feet. Authorities advised people to avoid beaches and low-lying areas until the threat subsided. Residents remained on alert for further waves.
